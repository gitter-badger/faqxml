faqxml
======

Generate FAQ lists in html, plain text or TeX/PDF from a single source written in XML.

The [http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/ DocBook] xml format includes the qandaset element for the creation of FAQ listings. This project implements a simple xsl stylesheet, which I found useful for my own purposes to create a simple FAQ list, intended for use in a website, where I wanted to see and control all of the details.

CONTENT TO COME.

This project is a modification of "faqxml" by Mikhail Yakshin [http://faqxml.sourceforge.net].
