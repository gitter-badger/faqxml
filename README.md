faqxml
======

Generate FAQ lists in html, plain text or TeX/PDF from a single source written in XML.

The [DocBook](http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/) xml format includes the qandaset element for the creation of FAQ listings. 

On the other hand, this project implements a simple xsl stylesheet, which I found useful for my own purposes to create a simple FAQ list (intended for use in a website), where I wanted to see and control all of the details.

???? By changing the headings, the same stylesheet can be used to produce a simple Glossary. 

CONTENT TO COME.

This project is a modification of "faqxml" by Mikhail Yakshin [http://faqxml.sourceforge.net]. Also uses ideas from the book *XSLT (Second edition)* by Doug Tidwell (O'Reilly, 2008).

Cross-referencing: uses the ID datatype; note Tidwell, page 192 on limitations of this.
